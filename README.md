🛰️ MQTT Gateway Prototype
This repository contains a prototype implementation of an MQTT Gateway, designed to act as a bridge between local devices/networks (e.g., sensors, microcontrollers, edge devices) and a central MQTT broker. The gateway handles protocol translation, message routing, and data preprocessing, enabling efficient and scalable communication for IoT systems.

🔧 Features
🧩 Protocol Bridging – Translates between MQTT and other local protocols (e.g., UART, HTTP, BLE, Modbus).

🔁 Message Routing – Routes data between edge devices and the MQTT broker based on configurable topics or rules.

🧠 Data Preprocessing – Optional transformation, filtering, or aggregation before publishing.

🔐 Secure Connectivity – Supports TLS encryption and authentication for secure communication with the broker.

📡 Offline Buffering – Stores messages locally if the broker is unreachable and forwards them when reconnected.

⚙️ Lightweight & Modular – Written in [language/framework you're using], with a modular design for easy customization and extension.


📦 Use Cases
Smart home or industrial IoT device integration

Edge-to-cloud communication in sensor networks

Secure data transmission over constrained or mixed networks
